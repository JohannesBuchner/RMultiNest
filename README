==========================
R Bridge for MultiNest
==========================

Author: Johannes Buchner (C) 2012

About
---------------------
This code allows likelihood functions written in R to be used by MultiNest.


How does it work
---------------------
The main program will connect to R using Rserve, and call R through that for 
each point evaluation.


Installation
---------------------

 1. Download Rserve from http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/ and put into this directory.
 
 2. go to Rserve/clients/ and compile the Rserve client.
 
   > ./configure && make 
 
 3. run make to compile Rbridge
   
   > make

 4. In R, install RServe using the instructions on the website. In short:
 
   > R
   >> install.packages("Rserve")


Running
---------------------

 1. Write log likelihood function in R (has to be called "log_likelihood")
   
   $ R
   
    > log_likelihood <- function(params) { 
    + print (params);
    + 0
    + }
  
 2. Run Rserve
 
    > library(Rserve)
    > Rserve()
 
 3. run ./rbridge in Shell

   $ ./rbridge

   This will connect to R using Rserve, and call R through that for each point evaluation.
